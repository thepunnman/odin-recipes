<p>As with most things on the internet, I cannot take credit for this recipe, though I have made one or two small tweaks to make it taste better to me. This is one of my girlfriend's favorite dishes of all time, and every time I make it for her, she falls in love with me all over again. Is it because she just loves pasta that much or is it because she really loves the vodka sauce? I guess we'll never know. <a href="https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/penne-alla-vodka">Here</a> is a link to the original recipe, for those interested.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just ignorant, but before I found and made this recipe, vodka sauce was always some mystical pasta sauce that was beyond my reach. Difficult to make, exotic ingredients, dangerous, and a bunch of other imaginary barriers had been erected in my mind that had prevented me from making vodka sauce. And, of course, as a result of these barriers, I had never tried it outside of a glass jar of Prego vodka sauce which was wholly underwhelming. So, when I stumbled across Stephen's Youtube channel and watched his tutorial on how to make vodka sauce, I was shocked. Not only was vodka sauce insanely easy to make, it looked so <em><strong>unbelievably delicious</strong></em> that I just had to make it the very next night.</p>
<p>If you make this, I promise it will end up as one of your go-to pasta sauces. Deceptively simple but absolutely packed with flavor, vodka sauce, though not traditional and will upset at least one Italian <i>nonna</i>, deserves a place among the greatest pasta sauces of all time.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound penne (I prefer rigatoni, but penne is traditional)</li>
    <li>1/3 pound proscuitto</li>
    <li>5-6 cloves of garlic, sliced thin</li>
    <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vodka of choice (I use Tito's)</li>
    <li>1 jar of passata</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste (I always end up putting in 1-2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>1 stem of fresh basil with leaves attached</li>
    <li>2-3 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of parsely diced finely for garnish</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely grated parmesan for garnish</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

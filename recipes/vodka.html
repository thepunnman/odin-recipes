<p>As with most things on the internet, I cannot take credit for this recipe, though I have made one or two small tweaks to make it taste better to me. This is one of my girlfriend's favorite dishes of all time, and every time I make it for her, she falls in love with me all over again. Is it because she just loves pasta that much or is it because she really loves the vodka sauce? I guess we'll never know. <a href="https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/penne-alla-vodka">Here</a> is a link to the original recipe, for those interested.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just ignorant, but before I found and made this recipe, vodka sauce was always some mystical pasta sauce that was beyond my reach. Difficult to make, exotic ingredients, dangerous, and a bunch of other imaginary barriers had been erected in my mind that had prevented me from making vodka sauce. And, of course, as a result of these barriers, I had never tried it outside of a glass jar of Prego vodka sauce which was wholly underwhelming. So, when I stumbled across Stephen's Youtube channel and watched his tutorial on how to make vodka sauce, I was shocked. Not only was vodka sauce insanely easy to make, it looked so <em><strong>unbelievably delicious</strong></em> that I just had to make it the very next night.</p>
<p>If you make this, I promise it will end up as one of your go-to pasta sauces. Deceptively simple but absolutely packed with flavor, vodka sauce, though not traditional and will upset at least one Italian <i>nonna</i>, deserves a place among the greatest pasta sauces of all time.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound penne (I prefer rigatoni, but penne is traditional)</li>
    <li>1/3 pound prosciutto</li>
    <li>5-6 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup of heavy cream, depending on how orange you want your vodka sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vodka of choice (I use Tito's)</li>
    <li>1 jar of passata</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste (I always end up putting in 1-2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>1 stem of fresh basil with leaves attached</li>
    <li>2-3 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of parsely diced finely for garnish</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely grated parmesan for garnish</li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons of butter</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To start, prepare the garlic and prosciutto. Slice the garlic very thin and slice the prosciutto into little strips. If you want this to be meatless, then omit the prosciutto but I highly recommend not leaving it out.</li>
    <li>Get a pot of salted water on the stove for the pasta and a wide-bottomed pan next to it to cook the sauce.</li>
    <li>In the pan <strong>(which should be cold)</strong>, add the prosciutto and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook the prosciutto until it just begins to crisp up and then add the basil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. The key is to try and time it so that you add the garlic at the perfect time to allow for it to cook and not burn and for the prosciutto to get crisp. If you don’t nail it, that’s fine, but when you start to see the garlic browning too much, it's time to deglaze and stop the cooking. If you want to omit the prosciutto (which is, again, <strong>not</strong> recommended), then just use olive oil and start this sauce by adding garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes to the oil.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Turn the heat off</em></strong> and then add the vodka, let it sizzle and calm down. Carelly turn the heat back on and reduce the vodka till it’s almost nothing. Fish out the basil and discard. Add the tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes on medium heat until it reduces and becomes very thick. This is also the point where, if you have one, you can melt in any extra parmesan rinds you have laying around. Stir often otherwise you risk the sauce burning to the bottom of the pan. Be careful of hot, splattering sauce. You can tell how thick it's getting by dragging a flat wooden spoon across the pan and look at how the sauce holds itself. <p><strong>Safety note:</strong> if you are using a gas stove, it is <em>incredibly</em> important that you turn off the heat when adding the vodka to the pan, otherwise the fumes will ignite and you will have a pillar of flames in your pan which can quite literally start a fire that will burn your house down. Let the vodka settle down in the pan before re-igniting the stove.</p></li>
    <li>Once the sauce is thick enough that it holds it's shape when stirring, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the cream, stirring occasionally. Taste for salt and add to taste. This is also the time when you should start cooking the pasta in that salted, boiling water we started earlier.</li>
    <li>Once the pasta is al dente, drain and transfer to the sauce and marry the sauce with the pasta for a couple of minutes until the sauce coats the pasta. Drop-in a 1-2 tablespoons of cold butter and a little pasta water to control the consistency of the sauce and then serve immediately with parmesan and fresh parsley</li>
</ol>
<h3>Chef's Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fresh parmesan is required, the green-top plastic cans won't cut it.</li>
    <li>Fresh basil is also mandatory. Not only will dried basil make the sauce look ugly, it won't flavor the sauce as well as fresh basil does.</li>
    <li>Starting in a cold pan is necessary so as to not burn the prosciutto. The pan coming up to temperature slowly allows the fat in the prosciutto to render before it becomes crisp.</li>
    <li> Milk of any kind is not an acceptable substitue for heavy cream. As well all know, milk curdles in the presence of acid, and tomatoes are highly acidic. Heavy cream will not curdle in a sauce like this.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with most things on the internet, I cannot take credit for this recipe, though I have made one or two small tweaks to make it taste better to me. This is one of my girlfriend's favorite dishes of all time, and every time I make it for her, she falls in love with me all over again. Is it because she just loves pasta that much or is it because she really loves the vodka sauce? I guess we'll never know. <a href="https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/penne-alla-vodka">Here</a> is a link to the original recipe, for those interested.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just ignorant, but before I found and made this recipe, vodka sauce was always some mystical pasta sauce that was beyond my reach. Difficult to make, exotic ingredients, dangerous, and a bunch of other imaginary barriers had been erected in my mind that had prevented me from making vodka sauce. And, of course, as a result of these barriers, I had never tried it outside of a glass jar of Prego vodka sauce which was wholly underwhelming. So, when I stumbled across Stephen's Youtube channel and watched his tutorial on how to make vodka sauce, I was shocked. Not only was vodka sauce insanely easy to make, it looked so <em><strong>unbelievably delicious</strong></em> that I just had to make it the very next night.</p>
<p>If you make this, I promise it will end up as one of your go-to pasta sauces. Deceptively simple but absolutely packed with flavor, vodka sauce, though not traditional and will upset at least one Italian <i>nonna</i>, deserves a place among the greatest pasta sauces of all time.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound penne (I prefer rigatoni, but penne is traditional)</li>
    <li>1/3 pound proscuitto</li>
    <li>5-6 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup of heavy cream, depending on how orange you want your vodka sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vodka of choice (I use Tito's)</li>
    <li>1 jar of passata</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste (I always end up putting in 1-2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>1 stem of fresh basil with leaves attached</li>
    <li>2-3 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of parsely diced finely for garnish</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely grated parmesan for garnish</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>To start, prepare the garlic and prosciutto. Slice the garlic very thin and slice the prosciutto into little strips. If you want this to be meatless, then omit the prosciutto but I highly recommend not leaving it out.</li>
    <li>Get a pot of salted water on the stove for the pasta and a wide-bottomed pan next to it to cook the sauce.</li>
    <li>In the pan <strong>(which should be cold)</strong>, add the prosciutto and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook the prosciutto until it just begins to crisp up and then add the basil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. The key is to try and time it so that you add the garlic at the perfect time to allow for it to cook and not burn and for the prosciutto to get crisp. If you don’t nail it, that’s fine, but when you start to see the garlic browning too much, it's time to deglaze and stop the cooking. If you want to omit the prosciutto (which is, again, <strong>not</strong> recommended), then just use olive oil and start this sauce by adding garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes to the oil.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Turn the heat off</em></strong> and then add the vodka, let it sizzle and calm down. Carelly turn the heat back on and reduce the vodka till it’s almost nothing. Now add the tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes on medium heat until it reduces and becomes very thick. This is also the point where, if you have one, you can melt in any extra parmesan rinds you have laying around. Stir often otherwise you risk the sauce burning to the bottom of the pan. Be careful of hot, splattering sauce. You can tell how thick it's getting by dragging a flat wooden spoon across the pan and look at how the sauce holds itself.</li>
    <li>Once the sauce is thick enough that it holds it's shape when stirring, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the cream. This is also the time when you should start cooking the pasta in that salted, boiling water we started earlier.</li>

<p>As with most things on the internet, I cannot take credit for this recipe, though I have made one or two small tweaks to make it taste better to me. This is one of my girlfriend's favorite dishes of all time, and every time I make it for her, she falls in love with me all over again. Is it because she just loves pasta that much or is it because she really loves the vodka sauce? I guess we'll never know. <a href="https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/penne-alla-vodka">Here</a> is a link to the original recipe, for those interested.</p>

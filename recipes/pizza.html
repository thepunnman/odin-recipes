    <p>Pizza is one of those things that's usually best enjoyed when a restaurant makes it. However, when it comes to Detroit-style pizza, there's absolutely no reason why you can't make it at home, and the pizza purists won't even be mad at you for it. Mostly.</p>
    <p>As someone who lives in Chicago, I'm a little bit opinionated on which city makes the best pizza. New York style pizza is good, but overrated. Chicago style pizza isn't deep dish like the majority have been led to believe. Chicago style pizza is tavern-style pizza, not deep dish. Both of which are good (better than New York style. There, I said it.), but even still one style of pizza reigns supreme above them all. Look away, Italians. It's not margherita.</p>
    <p>It's Detroit style pizza. And conveniently, it's the easiest to make at home.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><b>70% Hydration Pizza Dough</b> - Enough for one 10 x 14 inch Detroit Style Pizza Pan (or a 9x13 baking pan)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 grams of yeast</li>
        <li>210 grams of water</li>
        <li>300 grams of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 grams of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Toppings</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds of Wisconsin brick cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Pinch dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>The Simplest Pizza Sauce of All Time</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>28oz can of whole, peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 of one large onion (Vidalia, if possible)</li>
        <li>Pinch dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch dried basil</li>
        <li>Red chili flakes to taste</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dough</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the yeast to the warm water along with a spoonful of the flour. Stir until dissolved. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until light foam surfaces and little bubbles are visible. <b>Note:</b> Proofing is done to test the viability of the yeast. If there is no foam surface or little bubbles the yeast is likely dead and should be discarded for new yeast.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add the flour, and salt to a large mixing bowl. Once the yeast is proofed, pour in the mixture and mix the dough with your hands until no dry flour remains in the bowl and a cohesive mass forms.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes which will allow the dough to relax before kneading.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Gluten Development and 1st fermentation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>After resting, knead the dough in the bowl for 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut off a piece of the dough and stretch the dough thin to test for a gluten window.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm area until roughly doubled in size, about 60 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the can of tomatoes, butter, garlic, onion, oregano, basil, red pepper, and a small pinch of salt to a saucepan. Stir to combine. Set heat to medium-low and let cook undisturbed for 15 minutes. Stir once and let cook for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Blend sauce with an immersion blender, taste and add salt if needed.</li>
            <ul><li>Keeps in fridge up to one week.</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Proofing (2nd fermentation)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drizzle olive oil into a 10x14 Detroit style pizza pan until the bottom is lightly covered. Turn the ball of dough into the pan, grease both sides, and lightly flatten dough out to the edges.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan and let the dough proof for about 60-90 minutes, during which the dough will relax to the edges of the pan. At the end of proofing, the dough should be slightly puffy. Spread the dough out to the edges of the pan with your fingers and pop any really large air bubbles that may leave a thin spot in the dough.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prepare any additional toppings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add toppings</li>
        <ul>   
            <li>Sprinkle a little oregano and garlic powder evenly over the top of the dough.</li>
            <li>Add the toppings of choice (meats, veggies, etc.) next and spread the cheese all over the pizza ensuring it touches the edges of the pizza so we get the crispy edges when it bakes.</li>
            <li>Finish the pizza with a couple of spoonfuls of the sauce. I like doing it in 3 to 4 straight lines.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add pan to 450 F oven for 17-20 minutes, or until top of pizza is well browned.</li>
            <li>Remove to cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve with any extra toppings you want (extra parm, oregano, chili flakes, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chef's Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are unable to find Wisconsin brick cheese (which is traditional), full-fat, low-moisture mozzarella may be substituted.</li>
        <li>The order in which the pizza was built was very intentional. The sauce goes <em>on top</em> of the cheese for Detroit style pizza and the toppings <em>go under</em> the cheese.</li>
        <li>Specifically measure the dough ingredients by weight. I promise it's worth it.</li>
    </ul>

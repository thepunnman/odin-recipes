    <p>First of all, I cannot take credit for this recipe, all though it is my girlfriend's favorite chicken dish that I make for her. 
    I've mentioned credit to Chef John already, 
    but in case you're interested, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233170/sweet-hot-mustard-chicken-thighs/">here</a> 
    is the link to his original recipe.</p>
    <p>There's not much to say about the flavor combination of sweet and spicy that hasn't been said already. That being said, this is far and away
    one of the staple chicken dishes in my house. Chicken thighs are nearly impossble to overcook, 
    the mustard, cayenne, and honey create a flavor pallette that is hard to beat, and the onions that 
    the chicken is cooked on top of turn caramelized, sweet, and savory from being cooked in chicken fat.</p>
    <p>So, without further ado, let's jump into the recipe.</p>

    <p>First of all, I cannot take credit for this recipe, allthough it is my girlfriend's favorite chicken dish that I make for her. 
    I've mentioned credit to Chef John already, 
    but in case you're interested, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233170/sweet-hot-mustard-chicken-thighs/">here</a> 
    is the link to his original recipe.</p>
    <p>There's not much to say about the flavor combination of sweet and spicy that hasn't been said already. That being said, this is far and away
    one of the staple chicken dishes in my house. Chicken thighs are nearly impossble to overcook, 
    the mustard, cayenne, and honey create a flavor pallette that is hard to beat, and the onions that 
    the chicken is cooked on top of turn caramelized, sweet, and savory from being cooked in chicken fat.</p>
    <p>So, without further ado, let's jump into the recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large, bone-in chicken thighs (skin on!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey <em>or</em> 1/4 cup packed brown sugar (original recipe calls for brown sugar, I find that honey works better)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar, or any vinegar light in color (basically, anything except balsamic. The dark color will make the final product look unappetizing)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground, dried chipotle pepper (not optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne (or to taste, I like my chicken to make me sweat a little, so I usually put 1-2 teaspoons in)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced (this isn't one of those "I like lots of garlic, so I'm going to add lots of garlic" recipes, I promise this is enough)</li>
        <li>1 very large Vidalia onion, cut into half-inch (1cm) thick rings</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil (canola, peanut, etc.), or as needed</li>
    </ul>
